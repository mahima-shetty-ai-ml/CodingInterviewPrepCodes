You are given two strings S and T, and consisting of uppercase Latin alphabets. You want to make S equal to T.

You can perform either of the following operations on S any number of times to achieve it —

Remove one or more 'A' from string S.
Add 'B' at any position in the String S.
Input Format
First line contains T denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, The first and second lines contain strings S and T respectively.

1 <= T <= 5
1 <= |S|, |T| <= 1000
S, T consists of uppercase letters only
Output Format
For each test case, output "Yes" if possible to convert S to T, else "No".

Problem Statement
fullscreen
Tokyo finds that her boyfriend Rhio is cheating on him and she is in a fit of rage. She wants to destroy Rhio before exiting his life. Rhio has some crucial information stored with him in the form of strings. Tokyo knows that if Rhio loses the data, it would be a substantial loss for him so she decides to delete the data. 

Now, it takes m operations to delete an m digit number. She does not have this much of time so, she asks her guardian angel, the Professor to think of a way out. 

 He devises a method which says that she can delete parts of the number that have same digits consecutively i.e in one go. She could even concatenate the adjacent strings and delete them as a complete number if the above condition is satisfied. 

Now, she wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to delete all the data using the method. You need to help her to do so.

Given n positive integers, find the minimum number of operations required to delete all of them

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 30
1 ≤ Si < 1010
Input Format
First-line will input T, number of test cases.

The next pair of lines will input n and the respective numbers S1,S2…Sn in the next line.

Output Format
For every test case, output the required minimum number of operations to delete all of the numbers.

7
Explanation
111, 1111 and 111 can be concatenated and deleted taking 1 operation, as all 1 can be deleted together.

123 can be deleted separately taking 3 operations.

456, 677 and 77 can be concatenated together and can be deleted in 4 operations, as in 45667777 “66” can be deleted together and “7777” can be deleted together. Therefore total operations are 7.
